What is SingFlows ? 
===
_SingFlows_ is a research project in applied mathematics funded by the french agency [ANR](https://anr.fr/) under grant ANR-18-CE40-0027. Its goal is to develop mathematical and numerical tools for fluid flows with singularities. A detailed scientific description of the project can be found [here](/files/Scientific_description_Singflows.pdf)


Upcoming events
===

* _Mathematical Fluid Mechanics : 2nd advanced summer school_

This summer school, partly sponsored by _SingFlows_, will take place in Cargese, June 20-30 2023. It will promote exchanges between the theoretical mathematical developments on fluids and the more applied mathematics, on two main subjects : water waves and vortices.
